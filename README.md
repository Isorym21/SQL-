SQL/Database Programming

Multiple tables in Oracle were created, changed the value in a column, indicate the end of command, and defined a table’s structure by listing its columns, data types, and column lengths.​ Calculated a total of the values in a column, determined the number of rows in a table, joined tables, and included statistics calculated for only the groups or columns whose values are identical for each row in a group. Deleted whole tables and rows from a database. Updated tables and run commands to permanently save session-specific modifications. Created new tables using data from an existing database and added rows to them. Created views and table indexes. Change and remove tables.
